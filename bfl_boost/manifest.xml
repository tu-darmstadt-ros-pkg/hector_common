  <description brief="The Bayesian Filtering Library (latest) with Boost matrix class">

    This package contains a recent version of the Bayesian Filtering
    Library (BFL), distributed by the Orocos Project. Compared to the original bfl package by Klaas Gadeyne et. al., bfl_boost downloads the current 0.8 source release from the Orocos BFL website and applies a small patch to avoid copying of vectors and matrices when accessing its elements.
    The package name bfl_boost emphasizes the fact that the Boost uBLAS library is used as underlying matrix library.
